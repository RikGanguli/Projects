The goal is to build a library management application using a database backend to store information about members, documents, and so on. The application will
enable users to search for documents, borrow documents, enter new documents, etc. For this project, we record information for a single library and its users.

• Members: Members can search for documents, borrow documents, and return documents. Documents can be borrowed for certain time periods. If a member does not return a document by the due date, they will be
fined.
• Librarians: Librarians can check overdue documents, manage users, and add/delete/modify documents.

The main asset of the library is documents. For the project, we will consider the following types of documents:

• Books: Books are written by one or more authors and published by a publisher. Books have a title and may exist in different editions - each published in a certain year. For example, “Database System Concepts” 
is a book written by authors Silberschatz, Korth, and Sudarshan and published by McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math. The seventh edition was published in 2020.
• Journal Articles: Journal articles are written by one or more authors, have a title, and are published in a certain journal. Journals have a title and are published by a publisher in issues. Issues have editors and a
publication date. For example, “Science” is a scientific journal. The article “Antibody Therapeutics in Cancer” written by Mark X. Sliwkowski and IraMellman was published in the “13 September 2013” issue of this journal.
• Magazines: Magazines have a name and come in issues that are published at a certain time. Each issue of a magazine has a title. Magazine issues have editors and contributors.
• Thesis and Technical Reports

A library may have several copies of each document. Some documents may not exist as copies in the library. Copies are stored in a certain place inside the library,
e.g., a room, level,... For each copy, we need to know whether it is currently borrowed and if yes by which member. Members are only allowed to borrow
documents for a certain time (e.g., 2 weeks). We have also placed restrictions on the number of documents that can be borrowed by a user at a certain time.

The application supports the following actions. We indicate for each action whether it can be executed by librarians or library members.
• Search for documents (librarian/member)
• Borrow/return copies of documents (member)
• Add/Delete/Modify documents and copies (librarian)

We have also added the functionality to save searches which enables the user to store searches and re-execute them later.
